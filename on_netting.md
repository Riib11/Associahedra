# Netting K6

`K6` lies in on a 5-hyperplane in `R^6`. This means that even after transforming to `R^5` and then projecting into `R^4`, it is difficult to visualize. An approach to resolving this is to, rather than visualizing `K6` in its exact realization, breaking it down into a net, which satisfacorily lies in `R^3`.
