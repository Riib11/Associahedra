### Triangulations Graph
#
# + Creates a network of Triangulations,
#   where nodes represent (N - 1)-triangulations
#   on the given polygon (vertices)
#
# + An 'i-facet' is a group of Triangulations
#   in this graph where each of its triangulations
#   is i-linked to each other of its triangulations.
#
# + A 'vertex' is a 0-facet. Note that a vertex
#   is a group that consists of just 1 triangulation.
